# Responsive_Portfolio

## Description
Making a portfolio that is mobile responsive

We created a portfolio using Bootstrap CSS Framework.
It had to include a(n):
* Index page
* Portfolio page
* Contact page

We had to make it mobile responsive whenever looking at a 992px, 768px, or 400px screen.
The chrome developer tool helped us do this seeing what the website ultimately looks like on different size screens.
There were also screenshots provided as resources of what it should come out looking like.
